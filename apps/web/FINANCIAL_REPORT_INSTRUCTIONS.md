  - `[data-chart-type="expense-pie"]` - Expense distribution
  - `[data-chart-type="income-pie"]` - Income distribution
  - `[data-chart-type="expense-trend"]` - Expense category trends
  - `[data-chart-type="income-trend"]` - Income category trends

**Report Generation:**

### 7. Best Practices for Chart Capture
